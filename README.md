# Geesespotter-Game
Ever played Minesweeper before? Well, you'll like this game of Geesespotter as well. This game is played on the terminal,
and can be played in any format the user wants it (any dimensions with any feasible amount of geese). By printing out the board
after every move, the player has the freedom to continue playing, quit, restart and even mark spots with geese as given by the UI instructions.
Just like minesweper the main objective of the game is to not touch any spots with the geese, and if you do, the geese attacks you and the whole game
out of sight. So, be careful not to touch any!

To access the game, type in the following command
1. g++ -o main geesespotter.cpp geesespotter_lib.cpp      (press enter)
2. ./main.exe (press enter)

Your game should then appear.

Hope you enjoy!
